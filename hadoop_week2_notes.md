## My Week 2 – Lesson 1 notes:

### Overview of the Hadoop Stack

The Hadoop stack is made up of four main components: 
(1) Hadoop Commons – the libraries and utilities that make everything work, including the libraries for specific applicaitons.
(2) The HDFS (HSDF2 for Hadoop 2.0) – the underlying distributed file storage system for hte instance
(3) Hadoop YARN – the resource (cumpute and storage) allocation systems and schedulers etc.
(4) Hadoop MapReduce - the programming model for large scale processing. Also contains various applications.

Applications and Frameworks

Applications and frameworks, so HBase is a scalable data warehouse with support for large tables. Hive, a data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying. 
Pig, which is a high-level data-flow language and execution framework for parallel computation.
Spark, which is a fast and general purpose compute engine which can use the HDFS file system. 
Wide range of applications under Spark, ETL, Machine Learning, stream processing and graph analytics.
